# EC530_SQL-Application-Project

This is a hackathon project, where I created a chat-based spreadsheet assistant that loads CSV files and answers questions using SQL queries.

step1.py: Load a CSV into SQLite.
step2.py: Dynamically create tables from CSV and handle data types.
step3.py: Handle schema conflicts (e.g., adding missing columns).
step4.py: Simulate an interactive chat where users can load CSVs and run SQL queries.
step5.py: Integrate AI (like GPT-4) to generate SQL queries from plain language input
